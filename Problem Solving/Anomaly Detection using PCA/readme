Anomaly detection has many different applications. We can use it to find bad quality data.
Anomalies can be sometime a good desired property for example when it comes to customer surveys,
anomalies can pull out surveys where people spend more time taking the survey  and contain the most
informative information (most survey respondents tend to rush through surveys, anomaly respondents 
tend to think more through the survey).  Normally surveys have a huge amount of multicollinearity as people 
tend to click through them quickly,  interestingly enough much of that multicollinearity is reduced through 
this anomaly algorithm. This makes building insightful supervised models with survey data much easier.

In the problem I analyzed, I use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm to detect the anomalies. 
I hereby attach the knitted PDF and R-markdown file.
